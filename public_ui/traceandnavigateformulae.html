        <h4>This add-on will enhance your experience with Google Spreadsheets by providing an intuitive way to navigate through formulae and ranges. This allows you to understand your spreadsheets and find bugs faster. </h4>

        <h4>It brings 'Trace Dependents' and 'Trace Precedents', which are familiar to Excel users, into Google Sheets a more user-friendly way. And it allows for unlimited 'drilling' into, and out of, a formula.</h4>

        <h4>The app is designed to be faster and more reliable than similar apps on the market. </h4>
        
        <h4>Importantly, it does not store any user data outside of the user's computer, ensuring the continued privacy and security of the data on your spreadsheets.</h4>

                    <li> Trace into precedent ranges that are on different worksheets <span class="example">(e.g. "=B5+Sheet2!A2")</span></li>
                    <li> Trace into precedent ranges that are names <span class="example">(e.g. "=Price*Quantity")</span></li>
                    <li> Trace the direct dependents of a cell (in alpha mode) <span class="example">(e.g. if C3 = sum(A1, A2, A3, A4, A5), then include C3 as a dependent of each of them) </span></li>
